Plan for upgrading Haida stems/verbs.lexc

Generate the lexc file from the dictionary database with a single stem form for each lemma

gatáa CLASS-AA "to eat"

Then in each continuation lexicon, append a morphophoneme that indicates the conjugation class of the verb.  This will be used to trigger the correct allomorph of the following endings.

LEXICON CLASS-AA
ˆCC22  ENDINGS;


In the affixes file, mark each ending with one of seven morphophonemes which will trigger appropriate changes in the preceding verb stem.

LEXICON ENDINGS
+V+SINGULAR+IMPERATIVE:%>%^END1 # ;
+V+SIMPLE+PRESENT:%>%^END2gáng # ;

In twolc, then, we have rules which spell out what happens when the conjugation-class morphophoneme combines with the Endings morphophonemes.
