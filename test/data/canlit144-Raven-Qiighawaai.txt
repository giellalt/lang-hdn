# Skaai of the Qquuna Qiighawaai told at Hlghagilda, October 1900

# Hereabouts was all saltwater, they say. He kept on flying, Raven did, looking for land that he could stand on. After a time, beyond the Islands, there was one rock awash. He flew there to sit. Like sea-sausages,7 gods lay across it, putting their mouths against it side by side. The newborn gods were sleeping, out along the reef, heads and tails in all directions. It was light then, and it turned to night, they say. [Loon was living in Voicehandler's house. One day she went out and called. Then she flew back in and sat waiting, right where she usually sat. An old man lay there, not looking up at her. She went out a second time and called and hurried back in and sat. She kept saying the same thing. After a time, with his back to the fire, the old man said, «Tell me, Great Speechmaker, why do you keep on talking as you do?» «I am not talking only from my own mind. The gods tell me they need places to live. That is why I have been speaking.» And he said, «I am going to make some.»]8 Now when the Raven had flown a while longer, the sky in one direction brightened. It enabled him to see, they say. And then he flew right up against it. He pushed his mind through and pulled his body after. There were five villages strung out in a line. In the northernmost, the headman's favored daughter had just given birth to a child. When evening came, and they were sleeping,

# the Raven peeled the skin off the newborn child, starting at the feet, and put it on. Then he lay down in the child's place. Next day, his grandfather asked for the child and they passed him along. His grandfather washed him. Then, he pressed the child's feet against the ground and stretched him up to a standing position. Then he handed him back. Next day he stretched him again and handed him back to his mother. Now he was hungry. They had not yet started feeding him chewed-up food. Then evening came again, and they lay down, and when they slept, he raised his head and looked around. He listened throughout the house. All alike were sleeping. Then he untied himself from the cradle. He squirmed his way free and went outside. Something that was half rock, living in the back corner, watched him. While he was gone, it continued to sit there. He brought something in in the fold of his robe. In front of his mother, where the fire smoldered, he poked at the coals. He scooped out a cooking spot with a stick, and there he put the things that he carried. As soon as the embers had charred them, he ate them. They slithered. He laughed to himself. Therefore he was seen from the corner. Again it was evening and they lay down, and again he went out. He was gone for a while. Again he carried things back in the fold of his robe, and he brought them out and roasted them over the coals. Then he pulled them out and ate them, laughing to himself.
# The one that was half rock watched him from the corner. He ate them all, and then he lay down in the cradle. When morning came, all five villages were wailing. He could hear them. In four of the five villages, each of the people was missing an eye. Then one of the old people spoke, they say. «The newborn baby of the favored child goes out. I have seen him. As soon as they sleep, he gets up and leaves.» Then his grandfather gave him a marten-skin blanket and they wrapped it around him. His grandfather whispered and someone went out. «Come bring the baby of the favored child outsi-i-i-i-ide.» And as soon as the people had gathered, they stood in a circle, bouncing him up as they sang him a song. After a while they let him fall, and they watched him go down. Turning round to the right he went down through the clouds and struck water. Then as he drifted about, he kept crying. After his voice grew tired, he slept. He slept for a while, and then something said to him, «Your father's father asks you in.»9 He looked all around. He saw nothing. Again, when he had floated there awhile, something said the same thing. He looked around. He saw nothing. Then he looked through the eye of his marten-skin blanket. A pied-bill grebe appeared. «Your father's father asks you in.» As soon as he said this, he dived. Then he sat up. He was floating against a two-headed kelp. Then he stepped onto it.

# He was standing--yes!--on a two-headed stone housepole. Then he climbed down it. It was the same to him in the sea as it was to him above. Then he came down in front of a house, and someone invited him in. «Come inside, my grandson, the birds have been singing about your borrowing something from me.» Then he went in. At the back an elder, white as a gull, was sitting. And he sent him to get a box that hung in the corner. As soon as he had it, he pulled out the boxes within the box, totalling five. In the innermost box were cylindrical things, one colored like mother-of-pearl and one that was black, and he handed him these as he said to him, «You are me. You are that, too.» He spoke of some slender blue things turning black on top of the screens forming a point in the rear of the house. Then he said to him, «Set this one into the water, roundways up, and bite off part of the other and spit it at this.» But when the Raven brought them up, he set the black one into the water and bit off a part of the one like mother-of-pearl. When he spat that at the other, it bounced away. He did it the other way round from the way he was told, and that is the reason in bounced away. Now he went back to the black one and bit off a piece of it, and spat that at the other. Then it stuck. And he bit a part off of the one like mother-of-pearl and spat that at the other. It stuck. That is how trees started, they say.

# When he set this place into the water, it stretched itself out. The gods swam to it, taking their places. The mainland did the same, as soon as he set it into the water roundways up.
