%     Table of contents
%  1. Structure of the different POS
%  2. List of the tags, and their internal distribution

% The Document has two parts. 
% The first part outlines the internal structure of
% the complex POS, these should be built as boxes or panes.
% The last part is a list over the different morphosyntactic categories.

% The tags are in complementary distribution within each tag column.

% (incomplete) morphotactic survey
% ROOT + DER + POS + SUBPOS + ATTR + GRADE + NUM + CASE + PX + CLT  % noun
% ROOT + DER + POL + VN + MOOD + TNS + PN + CLT               % finite verb
% ROOT + DER + POL + VN + CASE + PX + CLT                     % infinite verb

% In case of homonymy, tags are unified. N=V means "can be N or V", and it
% should be found both by N and V search. Thus, N=V should be a covert member
% of a set N = {N, N=V, ...} and V = {V, N=V, ...}, respectively.

% 1. Structure of the different POS
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Tag syntax for the larger POS
% (this is an attempt at clarification, the list themselves come under 2.):
% Not all combinations within each box are possibe.

% "-" indicates optionality. It is perhaps not needed. "|" means "OR".
% The Function: list is listed below, and not indicated here.

% The name of these boxes are now legible, rather than the tags (tags in parentheses?)
