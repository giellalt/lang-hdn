----------------
The morphological analyses of wordforms of Northern Haida are presented
in this system in terms of following symbols.

(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).


Haida has these tags for real, says Jordan.
 * +V	 =
 * +NEGATIVE	 =
 * +3rd_PERSON_PLURAL	 =
 * +INTERROGATIVE	 =
 * +FUTURE	 =
 * +PAST	 =
 * +PRESENT	 =
 * +HABITUAL	 =
 * +BIASED	 =
 * +CERTAIN	 =
 * +SIMPLE	 =
 * +RELATIVE	 =
 * +NON_FACTIVE	 =
 * +IMMEDIATE	 =
 * +VERYNEAR	 =
 * +REFLEXIVE	 =
 * +NEAR	 =
 * +INDIRECT	 =
 * +DIRECT	 =
 * +SHOULD_KEEP_ON_VERBING_FOR_A_WHILE	 =
 * +SHORT	 =
 * +RESIGNED_OBLIGATION	 =
 * +LONG	 =
 * +INTENSIVE	 =
 * +IMPERATIVE	 =
 * +EVIDENTIAL	 =
 * +COUNTERFACTUAL	 =
 * +SINGULAR	 =
 * +PLURAL	 =

The parts-of-speech could perhaps also be (remove irrelevant):

 * +N	     =
 * +A	     =
 * +Adv     =
 * +Pron    =
 * +CS	     =
 * +CC	     =
 * +Adp     =
 * +Po	     =
 * +Pr	     =
 * +Interj  =
 * +Pcle    =
 * +Num     =

 * +Def   =
 * +Indef  =

The parts of speech are further split up into:

 * +Prop    =
 * +Pers    =
 * +Dem     =
 * +Interr  =
 * +Refl    =
 * +Recipr  =
 * +Rel     =
 * +Indef   =

The Usage extents are marked using the following tags:
 *  +Err/Orth      = Substandard forms
 *  +Use/-Spell   = Not included in speller

The nominals are inflected in the following Number

 * +Sg    =
 * +Pl    =



 * +ABBR  = Abbreviations
 * +ACR   = Acronyms


Special symbols are classified with:
 * +CLB    = Clause boundary symbols
 * +PUNCT  = Other punctuation marks
 * +LEFT   = Left part of paired symbols
 * +RIGHT  = Right part of paired symbols

The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
 * +TV 
 * +IV 

Special multiword units are analysed with:
 *  +Multi 

Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:
 *  +Guess 



The word forms in Haida start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:
 *   Verbs   ;
